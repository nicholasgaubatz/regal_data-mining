To run this notebook, ensure that config.py and xnetmf.py from the paper source code are in the same folder as this file. We probably shouldn't put them on GitHub, since we don't want to use any of their code.

*Example Representations.ipynb* and *representation.py* contain original code for Step 2 of the algorithm, while *Example Alignments.ipynb* and *aligning.py* contain original code for Step 3 of the algorithm. The notebook files contain tutorials and explanations.
